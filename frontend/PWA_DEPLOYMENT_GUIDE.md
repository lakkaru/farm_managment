# PWA Deployment Checklist & Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚀 Deployment Requirements for Proper PWA Installation

### ✅ Critical Requirements Fixed:

1. **HTTPS Protocol** - PWAs MUST be served over HTTPS in production
2. **Web App Manifest** - Now properly configured with all required fields
3. **Service Worker** - Generated with proper caching strategies
4. **Icons** - Multiple sizes generated (48x48 to 512x512)
5. **Meta Tags** - Apple/Microsoft specific tags added

### 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist:

1. **Update Deployment URL**
   ```javascript
   // In gatsby-config.js, update siteUrl to your actual deployment URL
   siteUrl: `https://your-actual-domain.netlify.app`
   ```

2. **Verify HTTPS**
   - Ensure your deployment platform serves over HTTPS
   - Most platforms (Netlify, Vercel) do this automatically

3. **Test Manifest**
   - Verify manifest is accessible at: `https://your-domain.com/manifest.webmanifest`
   - Check Chrome DevTools > Application > Manifest

### 🔧 Deployment Steps:

1. **Build & Deploy**:
   ```bash
   gatsby clean && gatsby build
   # Deploy the 'public' folder to your hosting platform
   ```

2. **Verify PWA Criteria**:
   - Open Chrome DevTools
   - Go to Application > Manifest
   - Check "Add to homescreen" criteria in Lighthouse

3. **Test Installation**:
   - Visit site on mobile browser (Chrome/Safari)
   - Look for "Add to Home Screen" prompt
   - Install and verify it opens as standalone app

### 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions:

#### Issue: Only creates shortcut (not proper app)

**Causes & Solutions:**

1. **HTTP instead of HTTPS**
   - Solution: Deploy to platform with HTTPS (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

2. **Incomplete Manifest**
   - Solution: Already fixed - manifest includes all required fields

3. **Missing Icons**
   - Solution: Already fixed - all icon sizes generated

4. **Browser Cache**
   - Solution: Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

5. **Service Worker Issues**
   - Solution: Check console for SW registration errors

#### Issue: Install prompt doesn't appear

**Solutions:**
1. Visit site multiple times (PWA criteria require user engagement)
2. Wait 5 seconds (our prompt has delay)
3. Check if already installed
4. Verify in Chrome: `chrome://flags/#bypass-app-banner-engagement-checks`

#### Issue: App doesn't work offline

**Solutions:**
1. Service worker needs time to cache resources
2. Visit pages you want cached while online
3. Check Network tab in DevTools for cached resources

### 🧪 Testing Tools:

1. **Chrome DevTools**:
   - Application > Manifest (check manifest validity)
   - Application > Service Workers (check SW status)
   - Lighthouse > PWA audit

2. **Manual Testing**:
   - Install app on phone
   - Turn off internet, test offline functionality
   - Check if app appears in app drawer (not browser bookmarks)

### 📱 Platform-Specific Notes:

**Android Chrome:**
- Shows "Add to Home Screen" banner
- App appears in app drawer
- Can be managed in Settings > Apps

**iOS Safari:**
- Requires manual "Add to Home Screen" from share menu
- No automatic prompts
- App appears on home screen

**Desktop Chrome:**
- Shows install button in address bar
- Creates desktop shortcut
- Opens in app window

### 🔍 Debugging Commands:

```bash
# Check manifest validity
curl https://your-domain.com/manifest.webmanifest

# Verify service worker
# Visit: https://your-domain.com/sw.js

# Test offline
# Chrome DevTools > Network > Offline checkbox
```

### ⚡ Performance Optimization:

1. **Minimize manifest size** ✅ Done
2. **Optimize icons** ✅ Done
3. **Efficient service worker** ✅ Done
4. **Fast loading** ✅ Gatsby optimization

### 🎯 Success Indicators:

✅ Lighthouse PWA score > 90
✅ Manifest validates without errors
✅ Service worker registers successfully
✅ Icons load properly
✅ App installs as standalone application
✅ Offline functionality works
✅ No browser UI when running installed app

## Next Steps:

1. Deploy to your hosting platform
2. Update `siteUrl` in gatsby-config.js to actual domain
3. Test on actual mobile device
4. Verify PWA criteria in Chrome DevTools
